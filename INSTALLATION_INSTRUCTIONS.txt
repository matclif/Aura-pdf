Aura PDF - Installation Instructions
==================================================

IMPORTANT: Before installing, please follow these steps:

1. CLOSE THE APP COMPLETELY
   - If you have "Aura PDF" running, close it completely
   - Check the system tray (bottom-right corner) and close it from there too
   - Or run the "close-app.bat" file to force close it

2. RUN THE INSTALLER
   - Double-click "Aura PDF Setup 1.0.0.exe"
   - Follow the installation wizard
   - Choose your installation directory
   - The installer will create a desktop shortcut automatically

3. IF YOU GET THE "CANNOT BE CLOSED" ERROR:
   - Click "Cancel" on the error dialog
   - Close the app manually from Task Manager:
     * Press Ctrl+Shift+Esc to open Task Manager
     * Find "Aura PDF" in the Processes tab
     * Right-click and select "End Task"
   - Then run the installer again

4. ALTERNATIVE: USE THE PORTABLE VERSION
   - If installation continues to fail, use "Aura PDF 1.0.0.exe"
   - This is a portable version that doesn't require installation
   - Run "install-windows.bat" to create desktop shortcuts manually

TROUBLESHOOTING:
- If you get permission errors when renaming files, run the app as administrator
- For cross-drive file operations, choose a destination folder you have write access to
- The app works best when files are on the same drive
